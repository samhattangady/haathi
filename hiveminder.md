# codename hiveminder

codename hiveminder is the first project that I am creating for the Astra Fellowship Jam Series.

## Abstract
The main concept for hiveminder is to create a simple city builder.

One week is obviously not enough time to build out a full-fledged city builder, so the idea is
to find the core of what makes the genre work, and then execute on that.

To start off, the concept is that the "city" that we are building is a beehive.

## Goals
The main goal is to try and distill that experience of a city builder, which is mostly about
balancing resources.

## Questions
- Would a turn based city builder work?

Just completed the first day of work on this. It seems interesting. The primary mechanic that seems
to be emerging is balancing food, jobs and population. Several jobs need to be done, maintenance,
building, food gathering, baby sitting etc. and each of those need bees. But also each bee needs 
food, and that needs more bees and so on.

From an executional perspective, the whole _hivemind_ idea feels really meta. There are systems where
different jobs and room request bees, and the bees just execute their duties based on the requests.

Most of the day was spent on planning and ideating. I have some very basic things set up, basically
just drawing a hex grid, and the ability to select cells within that.

The biggest concern I am seeing is that setting up the most basic version / prototype seems like it
will be a majority of the work, and I will not be able to see how the whole idea works until enough
of it is set up. So there may not be much time / opportunity to iterate based on that.

I feel like I am just sliding down the Dunning-Kruger slope today. I thought I knew how to go about
things yesterday, but for the most part I had to rethink a lot of things once it came down to the
details. So most of the day was just spent ideating and coding.

The big issue with such system based games is that until enough systems are set up, there is no
real scope to get anything running. So even just figuring out what was the smallest workable
thing I could get up and running was a challenge.

We have something now. I think atleast some of the systems are in place. It's not exactly working
correctly, but that's an issue to sort out tomorrow.

I have a feeling I am yet to reach the minima on that Dunning Kruger curve. Let's hope that's not
the case.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

It's not bad. I think we have most of the basic systems up and running now, which is a decent place
to be at this point. Tomorrow, we actually add the interactions, and see what are the things that
need to be changed and what are the interactions that make sense.

It's really coming together well. Almost all the systems are in place now. It's a little late though.
Ideally I'd have wanted to be in this position at the end of day 3. So now I have one day for tuning
(and theres a lot of tuning that's needed), and polish, presentation and completion.
Would have been nice to have more time for that.

Also I think because of the time constraint, while I was able to build out the systems, I wasn't
really able to play with them. So there was no real shot at finding emergence and highlight it within
the story/gameplay. While that is not an explicit goal of these jams, it is an overall goal. Though
maybe it is okay to skip out on them for now.

One more day of work. Let's see where we can reach =)
