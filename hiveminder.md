# codename hiveminder

codename hiveminder is the first project that I am creating for the Astra Fellowship Jam Series.

## Abstract
The main concept for hiveminder is to create a simple city builder.

One week is obviously not enough time to build out a full-fledged city builder, so the idea is
to find the core of what makes the genre work, and then execute on that.

To start off, the concept is that the "city" that we are building is a beehive.

## Goals
The main goal is to try and distill that experience of a city builder, which is mostly about
balancing resources.

## Questions
- Would a turn based city builder work?

Just completed the first day of work on this. It seems interesting. The primary mechanic that seems
to be emerging is balancing food, jobs and population. Several jobs need to be done, maintenance,
building, food gathering, baby sitting etc. and each of those need bees. But also each bee needs 
food, and that needs more bees and so on.

From an executional perspective, the whole _hivemind_ idea feels really meta. There are systems where
different jobs and room request bees, and the bees just execute their duties based on the requests.

Most of the day was spent on planning and ideating. I have some very basic things set up, basically
just drawing a hex grid, and the ability to select cells within that.

The biggest concern I am seeing is that setting up the most basic version / prototype seems like it
will be a majority of the work, and I will not be able to see how the whole idea works until enough
of it is set up. So there may not be much time / opportunity to iterate based on that.
