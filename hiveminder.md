# codename hiveminder

codename hiveminder is the first project that I am creating for the Astra Fellowship Jam Series.

## Abstract
The main concept for hiveminder is to create a simple city builder.

One week is obviously not enough time to build out a full-fledged city builder, so the idea is
to find the core of what makes the genre work, and then execute on that.

To start off, the concept is that the "city" that we are building is a beehive.

## Goals
The main goal is to try and distill that experience of a city builder, which is mostly about
balancing resources.

## Questions
- Would a turn based city builder work?
